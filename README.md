Instant-object-recognition && speech App, easy as 1, 2 ,3!

### Download our App using Expo

(
  if for some reason doesn't work, then it is probably b/c we stopped the server. 
  Give us a notice and we will be happy to re-run the server!
)

### then follow the steps
1. login (Email confirmation required) for signup
2. take a picuture (simple version comes with 200 objects quite accurate, funny comes with 9400 but less accurate)
3. experience the magic (press the circular-object-detected-button and hear its label in English)

!IMPORTANT notice : 
  * currently, machine learning behind simple camera is tiny-yolo
  (current server with 1G memory can only hold tiny, which also means it will crash on funny(yolo9000) camera)
  * In order to change yolo version, code can be found in runDarknet.js where I have written some comment
  * If we replace AWS EC2 server to c4.large, yolo2 and yolo9000 can be used and it will take 8-10 seconds
  * If we replace AWS EC2 server to any GPU server, it takes 3-4 seconds
  * If we change server code to preload weights on server, every process will take 3seconds less, (GPU 0-1seconds)
  (I personally like loading section, so Ive decided not to put weights on)
